# Mini-project-
Transcriptomic analysis of differentially expressed genes in type 2 diabetes using RNA-seq data

 **Project Overview:**
This project investigates the molecular basis of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) by identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). Transcriptomic profiling enables the discovery of key genes and pathways involved in glucose metabolism, insulin resistance, and pancreatic beta-cell function. Advanced bioinformatics tools are employed to uncover disease-specific biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Insights gained will deepen the understanding of T2D pathogenesis and support the development of personalized treatment strategies. This study bridges research and clinical applications in diabetes management.
